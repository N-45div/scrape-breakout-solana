# Scrape: Power AI, Share the Rewards

Scrape is a decentralized scraping hub that delivers model-ready data for AI builders while rewarding users for contributing their IPs. Built on Solana, we bypass bot detection, cut costs, and save 4+ hours weekly, enabling scalable, GDPR-compliant data collection.

## Why Scrape?

AI builders need diverse, high-quality data, but bot detection and costly proxies like Zyte and Bright Data limit access. 67% of organizations lack trust in their data, 45% face inconsistent data, and 52% worry about data quality, wasting hours on manual cleanup. Scrape solves this with model-ready data (JSONL, TFRecords, Parquet), AI-driven semantic filtering, and a decentralized network.

## Features

* **Model-Ready Data:** Structured formats (JSONL, TFRecords, Parquet) for AI training.
* **Time Savings:** Automates cleanup, saving 4+ hours weekly.
* **Bot-Resistant:** Decentralized proxy network bypasses bot detection.
* **Cost Efficient:** Reduces data collection costs significantly.
* **User Rewards:** Earn tokens by contributing IPs as a node operator.
* **Ethical & Scalable:** GDPR-compliant, with revenue sharing for node operators.
